Q NO-1
java is not pure object oriented programming language the reason behind 
this is java does not give support to full opps concept like multiple inheritance etc
more over java uses primitive data type which is no way related to objects
 thats the reoson java is not pure object oriented programming language
 
 
 Q NO-6
jvm execute main methode only then this methode as to be call without object 
then it should be a static . main method is no way related to objects


Q NO-9
 in java there are  five memory location is there namely 
 1 METHOD MEMORY AREA -  in this area the class level data and satatic variable 
 are stored
 2 HEAP MEMORY AREA- in this area the object level data and instance variable 
 are stored
 3 STACK MEMORY AREA- in this area the local variable are stored 
 4 P C REGISTER MEMORY AREA(PROGRAMME COLLECTOR MEMORY AREA)- in this area the 
 next execution adress are stored 
 5 NATIVE METHOD MEMOEY AREA- in this area the native information from parent C and C++
 data are stored
 
 
 Q NO-10
   INSTANCE VARIABLE                           LOCAL VARIABLE
 1-  the value of the variable vary from        1-  to achiev some task the programmer 
 object to object then the variable is known      need some temparary variable with in 
 as instance variable                           the block that vaeiable is known as local    
  2- the instance variable declare with in the   2- local variable declare with in the
  class but out side the methode, block           block, method
 3- the instatnce variable is creat while object   3- the local variable created while
 creation and destroy at a time of object destroy    block creation and destroy at a 
 then the scope of the instance variable is same     time of block destroy then the scope ia
 object                                               same as block
 4- the instance variable is stored in heap memory   4- local are stored in stack memory area
 area
 5-for instatce variable the jvm will give default  5-for local initialization is explicitly 
 values we are not required to give initialization     required
 explicitly
 
 
 
 Q NO -11
 if we are not declare main method as static the jvm is not going to 
 execute main method beacuse of 
 before creating a object we cannot call instace methode 
 to creat a object we want to execute first  then only the object
 created thats the reason the main methodeis static mai method is no way related to object
 
 
 Q NO -12
  jdk full form is java development kit 
  jdk is set of tools and it is responsible for development and also 
  execution of java programmer
   THE VARIANT OF JDK
   1- jdk for windows
   2- jdk for mac
   3 - jdk for linux
   etc
   
   
   
  Q no 13
   the difference b/w jdk jre and jvm
    jdk-java development kit is a set of tools and responsible for 
	development and execution and it contain jre and development tools
	
	
   jre- java runtime environment is responsible for to give run time
   environment to our java programmerand it contains jvm and some library
   
   
   jvm- java vartual machine is responsible for execution our java programme
